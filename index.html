              Hello, world! My name is Shannon Grantski. I'm currently a student in web development based out of Seattle, Washington.  I love taking naps, sleeping in, dozing off, and also cats.
            </p>

            <h2> Background: </h2> 
            <p>
              I decided to enroll at Epicodus for a change of pace, career-wise. Prior to this, all of my work experience has been in the service industry in one fashion or another. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been a barista at the largest and most ubiquitous of all coffee chains, and I've been a hostess at the smallest and coziest of English-style tea houses, and a few other places in between. </p>
            <p>
              With <em>the Quarantine™</em> and all, I've been given the time to reflect, and I feel like it's time for me to break out of the cups and mugs.
            </p>

            <h2> Interests: </h2>
            <p>
              Thanks to <em>the Quarantine™</em>, my hobbies have had to narrow down in scope &mdash; so these days you'll mostly find me playing <a href="img/acnh.jpg"><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></a>. I otherwise spend my time looking for cats to adopt &mdash; I don't have any pets right now, but hopefully that will change soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other games I'm playing:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </li>
              <li> Final Fantasy VII: Classic </li>
              <li> Crypt of the Necrodancer: Cadence of Hyrule </li>
              <li> Just Dance 2020 </li>
              <li> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity </span> </li> 
              <p>(It hasn't come out yet... but when it does...)</p>
            </ol>

                This HTML page is another project in the trial of learning CSS. In this page, we further explore customization by class, as well as floats and margins.

                A first foray into CSS styling. Ambitions were thwarted on some elements, but we were able to demonstrate some specificity of customization within text color and presentation.

                A duo of HTML pages to cover the very basic building-blocks of the web. An understanding of the fundamentals is crucial! In these pages, we play around with embedded images, hyperlinks, and text styling options like headers, emphasis, and lists.
