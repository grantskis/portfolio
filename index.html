              Hello, world! My name is Shannon. I'm currently a student in web development based out of Seattle, Washington.  I love taking naps, sleeping in, dozing off, and also cats.

            <h2> Background: </h2> 
            <p>
              I decided to enroll at Epicodus for a change of pace, career-wise. Prior to this, all of my work experience has been in the service industry in one fashion or another. I've been a barista at the largest and most ubiquitous of all coffee chains, and I've been a hostess at the smallest and coziest of English-style tea houses, and a few other places in between. With the Quarantine™ and all, I've been given the time to reflect, and I feel like it's time for me to break out of the cups and mugs.

            <h2> Interests: </h2>
            <p>
              Thanks to the Quarantine™, my hobbies have had to narrow down in scope &mdash; so these days you'll mostly find me playing <a href="img/acnh.jpg">Animal Crossing</a>. I otherwise spend my time looking for cats to adopt &mdash; I don't have any pets right now, but hopefully that will change soon.

                This HTML page is another project in the trial of learning CSS. In this page, we further explore customization by class, as well as floats and margins.

                A first foray into CSS styling. Ambitions were thwarted on some elements, but we were able to demonstrate some specificity of customization within text color and presentation.

                A duo of HTML pages to cover the very basic building-blocks of the web. An understanding of the fundamentals is crucial! In these pages, we play around with embedded images, hyperlinks, and text styling options like headers, emphasis, and lists.
